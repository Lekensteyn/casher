Casher is a Ruby script used by [Travis Build](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build) to fetch, create, and update caches. Casher fetches a cache if one exists and creates one if it doesn't. It uses md5deep to detect changes in an existing cache and updates the cache if a difference in the MD5 checksums are found.

## Where it fits in

[Travis Build](https://github.com/travis-ci/travis-build) generates a signature and URL for a cache and sends it to Casher. Casher checks the URL to see if there is an existing cache. If one is not found, it creates one. If one is found, it pulls the cache from S3 (Docker builds) or GCS (GCE and MacStadium builds) and expands it from the root of the OS. 

Travis Build can tell Casher to add the directories or shortcuts (bundler, pip) to the cache specified in a user's .travis.yml. Casher then runs md5deep which can recursively compute the MD5 for every file in a directory. Travis Build will then run `before_cache` specifications in a user's .travis.yml to remove files that could change the checksum and invalidate the cache. If the MD5 checksums are different, Casher will create a new cache and store it at the URL sent to it by Travis Build originally.

## Status

Casher is still actively used by both Travis for private repositories and Travis for open source. It is maintained by @BanzaiMan and falls under Team Sapphire's domain.
